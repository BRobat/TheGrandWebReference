### 1. Explain event delegation  
answer:  
Event delegation allows us to attach a single event listener (for example cell in a table) to a parent element (table), that will fire for all descendants matching a selector, whether those descendants exist now or are added in the future.

### 2. Explain how event delegation works in JavaScript  
answer:  
The best explanation I think is thru code. So here is some code for highlighting cells in a table:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="3"><em>Bagua</em> Chart: Direction, Element, Color, Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>...<strong>Northwest</strong>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>...2 more lines of this kind...</tr>
  <tr>...2 more lines of this kind...</tr>
</table>
```

```javascript
table.onclick = function(event) {
    let td = event.target.closest('td');

    if (!td) return;

    if (!table.contains(td)) return;

    highlight(td);
};
```
...method `elem.closest(selector)` returns the nearest ancestor that matches the selector. In our case we look for `<td>` on the way up from the source element.
...If `event.target` is not inside any `<td>` then the call returns null, and we don't have to do anything.
...In case of nested tables, `event.target` may be a `<td>` lying outside of the current table. So we check of that's actually our table's `<td>`
...And, if it's so, then higlight it.


### 3. Explain how prototypal inheritance works  
answer:  
What is prototype?  
A prototype of an object is just another object that is used as fallback source of properties. When an object gets a request for a property that it does not have, its prototype will be searched for the property, then the prototypeâ€™s prototype, and so on.  
What is inheritance?  


Now as we know what inheritance and prototype are
